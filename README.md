hour you?
=========

Chrome extension to translate all dollar amounts to number of hours it would take to earn that much money working a minimum wage job.

This extension is supposed to help you visualize how much work it really takes many people to afford what you browse online.

Currently, income tax is not taken into consideration which would increase the required number of hours even more.

Feedback welcome!
